It is possible to run excited states calculations with the quantum
package. To do this, set \fBdeterminants n_states\fP to the number
of requested states. The selection criterion will be the maximum of the
selection criteria for each state. If the Davidson diagonalization has
difficulties to converge, increase the \fBdavidson n_states_diag\fP
value.
.sp
When computing multiple states, it is good to have the
\fBdeterminants s2_eig\fP flag \fBtrue\fP\&. This will force the Davidson
algorithm to choose only vectors with a value of \ewidehat{S^2} equal to
\fBdeterminants expected_s2\fP\&. Otherwise, different spin states
will come out in the diagonalization.
.sp
The \fIQuantum Package\fP doesnâ€™t take account of the symmetry. Due to numerical noise,
excited states of different symmetries may enter in the calculation.
Note that it is possible to make state\-average calculation of states
with different symmetries and/or different spin multiplicities.
.sp
To include excited state of all possible symmetries, a simple trick is
to run a preliminary multi\-state CIS calculation using the CIS
program, and then running the selected FCI restarting from the CIS
states, setting \fBdeterminants read_wf\fP to \fBtrue\fP\&.
.sp
Usually, it is good practice to use state\-averaged natural MOs so that
all states have MOs of comparable quality. This allows for a faster
convergence of excitation energies.
