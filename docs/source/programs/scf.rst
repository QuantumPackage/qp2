 The :ref:`scf` program performs *Restricted* Hartree-Fock 
 calculations (the spatial part of the |MOs| is common for alpha and beta 
 spinorbitals). 
  
 It performs the following actions: 
  
 #. Compute/Read all the one- and two-electron integrals, and store them 
    in memory 
 #. Check in the |EZFIO| database if there is a set of |MOs|. 
    If there is, it will read them as initial guess. Otherwise, it will 
    create a guess. 
 #. Perform the |SCF| iterations 
  
 For the keywords related to the |SCF| procedure, see the ``scf_utils`` 
 directory where you will find all options. 
  
 At each iteration, the |MOs| are saved in the |EZFIO| database. Hence, 
 if the calculation crashes for any unexpected reason, the calculation 
 can be restarted by running again the |SCF| with the same |EZFIO| 
 database. 
  
 To start again a fresh |SCF| calculation, the |MOs| can be reset by 
 running the :ref:`qp_reset` command. 
  
 The `DIIS`_ algorithm is implemented, as well as the `level-shifting`_ 
 method. If the |SCF| does not converge, try again with a higher value of 
 :option:`level_shift`.
