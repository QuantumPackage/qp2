Module defining the generator determinants as those belonging to a |CAS|.
The |MOs| belonging to the |CAS| are those which were set as active with
the :ref:`qp_set_mo_class` command.

This module is intended to be included in the :file:`NEED` file to define
the generators as the |CAS| determinants, which can be useful to define post-CAS approaches (see cassd module for instance).
