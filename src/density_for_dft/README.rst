===============


This module defines the *provider* of the density used for the |DFT| related
calculations.  This definition is done through the keyword
:option:`density_for_dft density_for_dft`.  The density can be:

* `WFT`: the density is computed with a potentially multi determinant wave
  function (see variables `psi_det` and `psi_det`)# input_density: the density
  is set to a density previously stored in the |EZFIO| directory (see
  ``aux_quantities``)
* `damping_rs_dft`: the density is damped between the input_density and the WFT
  density, with a damping factor of :option:`density_for_dft damping_for_rs_dft`
