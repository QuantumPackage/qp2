[density_for_dft]
type: character*(32)
doc: Type of density used for DFT calculation. If set to WFT , it uses the density of the wave function stored in (psi_det,psi_coef). If set to input_density it uses the one-body dm stored in aux_quantities/ . If set to damping_rs_dft it uses the damped density between WFT and input_density. In the ks_scf and rs_ks_scf programs, it is set to WFT.
