hartree_fock
============


The :ref:`scf` program performs *Restricted* Hartree-Fock
calculations (the spatial part of the |MOs| is common for alpha and beta
spinorbitals).

The Hartree-Fock algorithm is a |SCF| and therefore is based on the
:ref:`module_scf_utils` module. 

The Fock matrix is defined in :file:`fock_matrix_hf.irp.f`.
