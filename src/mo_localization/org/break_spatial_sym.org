! A small program to break the spatial symmetry of the MOs.

! You have to defined your MO classes or set security_mo_class to false
! with:
! qp set orbital_optimization security_mo_class false

! The default angle for the rotations is too big for this kind of
! application, a value between 1e-3 and 1e-6 should break the spatial
! symmetry with just a small change in the energy.
