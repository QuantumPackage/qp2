ao_cart_one_e_integrals
=======================

All the one-electron integrals in the cartesian |AO| basis are here.

The most important providers for usual quantum-chemistry calculation are:

* `ao_cart_kinetic_integrals` which are the kinetic operator integrals on the |AO| basis 
* `ao_cart_integrals_n_e` which are the nuclear-elctron operator integrals on the |AO| basis
* `ao_cart_one_e_integrals` which are the the h_core operator integrals on the |AO| basis
